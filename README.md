# Image Compositing and Filter Mathematics in PHP

This is the readme.

Michael will make the slides available via a link.

Repository is available [here](https://github.com/mredig/Mathematics-of-Image-Processing).

A preconfigured virtual machine can be downloaded via the included torrent file. See below:


Requirements to follow along:
* PHP webserver (probably 7+ - might work on older versions)
* git
* Code editor
	* I like Atom
* (optional) FTP client
	* I like Cyberduck
* (optional) VirtualBox with a Linux VM
	* getting a webserver running on a Linux VM is easier/better than using Windows
		* `apt install php php-gd apache2`
	* torrent file to download a preconfigured VM is included. In VirtualBox, you will want to *Import Appliance* and select the completed download. The user information is included on the desktop of the VM
